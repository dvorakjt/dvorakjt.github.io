This page is an exercise in simplicity and elegance of design, eye-catching animations, composition (note how the background draws the user's eye to the bottom of the page, encouraging them to keep scrolling for more content), and completeness yet directness of content. The app uses javascript to power a few simple animations (text fading in and out, text content changing), the Bootstrap framework for buttons, the carousel (and its animation), and overall layout, the Bulma framework for attractively simple cards (called boxes in Bulma), a custom CSS sheet for a few stylings, Google Fonts for an appealing typeface, fontawesome for a few symbols, and a background from SVGbackgrounds.com. It is also an improvement over the last design in terms of mobile-readiness.

### Technologies

The app is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma, Javascript, jQuery, Google Fonts, Fontawesome and SVGBackgrounds.com

## Usage

The first thing you can do from the homepage is view more information about me and my interests. The 'Tell me more!' button causes the intro text to fade out. It is replaced by About Me text and the opacity is restored to 1. You can click the "Coding and Music" to hear a little bit about my interest in coding and music. Finally, the "Who are you again ..?" button takes you back to the intro text. The next card features a carousel with screenshots of my projects, and links to both the deployed apps and their respective repos. The technology card lists the technologies I have worked with, and finally the contact me button at the bottom brings up my contact information, which is also animated using js.
